## What is it ?

Str8Tween is a tween engine designed for [Unity](https://unity.com/) and the very first project of [Str8lines](https://str8lines.io).
It's meant to grow as much as possible and be a free alternative to other tween engines.

Initially it handles only basic animations for UI components with four different properties : position, scale, rotation, transparency.
Hopefully more animations will be added in the future even for 3D Objects.

It is made for Unity game developers or students who are looking for a way to create very basic animations.

## Download
